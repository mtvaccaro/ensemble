# localStorage Mode - No Backend Required! üéâ

## What We Just Implemented

Your Unspool Studio app now works **completely offline** with full data persistence using browser localStorage. No Supabase, no database, no backend needed!

## How It Works

### 1. **localStorage Utility** (`lib/localStorage.ts`)
- Save/load podcast subscriptions
- Add/remove individual podcasts
- Get podcast by ID
- Clear all data

### 2. **Persistent Demo Mode** (`app/podcasts/page.tsx`)
- Subscribe to podcasts ‚Üí **saved to localStorage**
- Unsubscribe ‚Üí **removed from localStorage**  
- View subscriptions ‚Üí **loaded from localStorage**
- **Persists across browser sessions!**

### 3. **Episode Pages** (`app/podcasts/[id]/page.tsx`)
- Loads podcast data from localStorage first
- Falls back to mock data if not found
- Shows real artwork and metadata

## What You Can Do Now

‚úÖ **Search for podcasts** - Real iTunes API data  
‚úÖ **Subscribe to podcasts** - Saved to localStorage  
‚úÖ **View episodes** - Click podcast titles  
‚úÖ **Unsubscribe** - Removed from localStorage  
‚úÖ **Close browser** - Data persists!  
‚úÖ **Reopen browser** - All subscriptions still there!

## Testing It

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/podcasts
2. Search for "behind the money" or "tech"
3. Click "Subscribe" on any podcast
4. **Close the browser completely**
5. **Reopen** and go back to the page
6. Your subscriptions are still there! üéâ

## Limitations (By Design)

- ‚ùå No cross-device sync (localStorage is per-browser)
- ‚ùå No cross-browser sync (Chrome data ‚â† Safari data)
- ‚ùå ~5-10MB storage limit (plenty for podcast metadata)
- ‚ùå No multi-user support

## Benefits for MVP Development

‚úÖ **Zero setup** - No database configuration  
‚úÖ **Fast iteration** - Change code, test immediately  
‚úÖ **Build features** - Transcription, clips, etc. work the same  
‚úÖ **Easy migration** - When ready, swap localStorage calls with API calls

## File Changes

- **NEW**: `lib/localStorage.ts` - Storage utilities
- **UPDATED**: `app/podcasts/page.tsx` - Uses localStorage instead of API
- **UPDATED**: `app/podcasts/[id]/page.tsx` - Loads from localStorage first

## Next Steps

Now you can build:
1. **Transcription** - Add OpenAI Whisper (store transcripts in localStorage)
2. **Clip Creation** - Select segments, save metadata
3. **Export** - Generate video clips
4. **Polish** - Loading states, toasts, animations

When you're ready for production:
- Set up Supabase
- Replace `storage.xxx()` calls with `fetch('/api/...')` calls  
- Done!

## Storage Format

```javascript
// localStorage key: 'clipper_subscribed_podcasts'
[
  {
    id: "1376303362",
    title: "Behind the Money",
    author: "Financial Times",
    feed_url: "https://...",
    image_url: "https://...",
    categories: ["Business", "News"],
    episode_count: 50,
    created_at: "2025-10-17T...",
    updated_at: "2025-10-17T..."
  },
  // ... more podcasts
]
```

## Development Workflow

1. Work on features using localStorage
2. Test everything locally
3. When MVP is solid, add Supabase
4. Gradually migrate localStorage ‚Üí API
5. Keep localStorage as fallback for offline mode
